# RESTful APIs
**Representational State Transfer (REST)** is a set of architectural constraints for applications that communicate using HTTP methods. APIs that use `REST constraints` are called RESTful (or just REST) APIs. RESTful design depends on **six key constraints**:
1. **Uniform Interface:** Interaction should be consistent regardless of the client (mobile, IoT, desktop, etc.).
2. **Client/Server Architecture:** Clear separation between client (consumer) and server (provider).
3. **Stateless:** Each request must contain all necessary information; servers don‚Äôt retain state between requests.
4. **Cacheable:** Servers can indicate whether responses are cacheable to improve efficiency.
5. **Layered System:** Clients should not need to understand the underlying server architecture.
6. **Code on Demand (Optional):** Allows servers to send executable code to clients for execution.

> **Caching** is a method of increasing request throughput by storing commonly requested data on the client side or in a server cache.

>[!important]
>REST is a style rather than a protocol, so each RESTful API may be different. It may have methods enabled beyond CRUD, its own sets of authentication requirements, subdomains instead of paths for endpoints, differentrate-limit requirements, and so on.

### REST Request-Responses
> [!code] GET Request to Inventory API
> ```http
> GET /api/v3/inventory/item/pillow HTTP/1.1
> HOST: rest-shop.com
> User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
> Accept: application/json
> ```

> [!code] Resulting Response
> ```http
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Server: RESTfulServer/0.1
> Cache-Control: no-store
> Content-Type: application/json
> {
"item": {
"id": "00101",
"name": "pillow",
"count": 25
"price": {
"currency": "USD",
"value": "19.99"
}
},
}
> ```

>One thing to note: the rest-shop.com store provided all the information it had about the resource ‚Äúpillow‚Äù in its response. If the consumer‚Äôs application only needed the name and value of the pillow, the consumer would need to filter out the additional information. `The amount of information sent back to a consumer completely depends on how the API provider has programmed its API.`

### Common REST API Headers
There are some common HTTP Headers often used in RESTful APIs. These Headers will help to indentify and get familiar with REST API.
#### Authorization
Authorization headers are used to pass a token or credentials to the API provider. The format of these headers is Authorization: `<type> <token/credentials>` .
>Authorization: Bearer Ab4dtok3n

AWS-HMAC-SHA256 is an AWS authorization type that uses an access key and a secret key.
#### Content Type 
Content-Type headers describe the media you‚Äôre sending. Here are some common Content-Type headers for REST APIs:
- **application/json:**‚ÄÇUsed to specify `JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)` as a media type. **JSON is the most common media type for REST APIs.**
- **application/xml:**‚ÄÇUsed to specify XML as a media type.
- **application/x-www-form-urlencoded:**‚ÄÇA format in which the values being sent are encoded and separated by an ampersand (&), and an equal sign (=) is used between key/value pairs.
#### Middleware (X) Headers
`X-<anything>` headers are known as **middleware** headers and can serve all sorts of purposes. They are fairly common outside of API requests as well. ***X-Response-Time*** can be used as an API response to indicate how long a response took to process. ***X-API-Key*** can be used as an authorization header for API keys. ***X-Powered-By*** can be used to provide additional information about back-end services. ***X-Rate-Limit*** can be used to tell the consumer how many requests they can make within a given time frame. ***X-RateLimit-Remaining*** can tell a consumer how many requests remain before they violate rate-limit enforcement. (There are many more, but you get the idea.) `X-<anything>` middleware headers can provide a lot of useful information to API consumers and hackers alike.

> [!NOTE] ENCODING DATA
> HTTP requests use encoding as a method to ensure that communications are handled properly. Various characters that can be problematic for the technologies used by the server are known as **bad characters**. One way of handling bad characters is to use an encoding scheme that formats the message in such a way as to remove them. Common encoding schemes include Unicode encoding, HTML encoding, URL encoding, and base64 encoding. XML typically uses one of two forms of Unicode encoding: UTF-8 or UTF-16.

# GraphQL
**GraphQL** stands for **Graph Query Language**, a specification for APIs that allows clients to **define the structure of the data they want**. It is often compared to **SQL** due to its **query-centric approach**. **GraphQL is RESTful** as it adheres to the six constraints of REST APIs but differs in how data is requested.
### How GraphQL Works?
- **Data Structure:** Stores resources in a **graph data structure**.
- **Single Entry Point:** Uses a single URL and **POST requests** for interaction.
- **Query Definition:** The client sends **query parameters** in the request body, which resembles a database query.
### Benefits of GraphQL Over REST APIs
- **Precise Data Retrieval:** Clients can **request specific fields** from a resource, avoiding unwanted data.
- **Reduced Requests:** Allows fetching **all required data in a single request**.
- **Improved Efficiency:** Unlike REST APIs, clients **don‚Äôt receive unnecessary data**; they only get what they request.
### GraphQL Request Example (API Interaction)
```http title="Request"
POST /graphql HTTP/1.1
HOST: graphql-shop.com
Authorization: Bearer ab4dt0k3n

{
  query {
    inventory(item: "Graphics Card", id: 00101) {
      name
      fields {
        price
        quantity
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```HTTP title="JSON Response"
{
  "data": {
    "inventory": {
      "name": "Graphics Card",
      "fields": [
        {
          "price": "999.99",
          "quantity": 25
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

>[!info] Single Endpoint Efficiency
>Unlike REST APIs, GraphQL uses a single endpoint for fetching different pieces of information (e.g., brand and quantity of a graphics card) through a single query.

### üìå**GraphQL CRUD Operations via POST Requests**

>Unlike REST APIs where different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used for CRUD operations, GraphQL **typically uses only POST requests** for all operations.

**WHY??**
- Because GraphQL requests are sent as a single query string (or a JSON object) within the body of a POST request.
- **POST requests** are flexible and allow complex queries or mutations to be specified within the request body.
- Despite using POST requests, GraphQL still supports CRUD-like operations through `queries, mutations, and subscriptions.`
#### Query, Mutation, and Subscription Explained
1. **Query** (Read)
		- Used to **retrieve data** from the server.
		- Similar to a **GET request** in REST.
		- Example: Fetching user profile details or fetching a list of posts.
2. **Mutation** (Create, Update, Delete)
		- Used to **modify data** on the server.
		- Covers actions like **creating, updating, or deleting resources**.
		- Equivalent to **POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests** in REST.
3. **Subscription** (Live Data) ***
		- Used for **real-time updates** from the server.
		- Clients can subscribe to specific events or data changes, and the server pushes updates when they occur.
		- Example: Receiving live chat messages or real-time stock price updates.

# SOAP
**Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)** is a type of action-oriented API that relies on `XML`. SOAP is one of the **older** web APIs. It was primarily designed for used over HTTP. But it can also works over HTTP, SMTP, TCP, and UDP. 
> When SOAP is used over HTTP, the requests are all made using HTTP POST

### Example Request-Response
```HTTP title="Request"
POST /Inventory HTTP/1.1
Host: www.soap-shop.com
Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: nnn
<?xml version="1.0"?>
[1] <soap:Envelope
[2] xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/"
soap:encodingStyle="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-encoding">
[3] <soap:Body xmlns:m="http://www.soap-shop.com/inventory">
<m:GetInventoryPrice>
<m:InventoryName>ThebestSOAP</m:InventoryName>
</m:GetInventoryPrice>
</soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

```HTTP title="Response"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: nnn
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<soap:Envelope
xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/"
soap:encodingStyle="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-encoding">
<soap:Body xmlns:m="http://www.soap-shop.com/inventory">
[4] <soap:Fault>
<faultcode>soap:VersionMismatch</faultcode>
<faultstring, xml:lang='en">
Name does not match Inventory record
</faultstring>
</soap:Fault
</soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

>[!check] Components of SOAP request and response
>SOAP API messages are made up of four parts: the envelope [1] and header [2], which are necessary, and the body [3] and fault [4], which are optional. The envelope is an XML tag at the beginning of a message that signifies that the message is a SOAP message. The header can be used to process a message; in this example, the Content-Type request header lets the SOAP provider know the type of content being sent in the POST request (application/soap+xml)
>
>Since APIs facilitate machine-to-machine communication, headers essentially form an agreement between the consumer and the provider concerning the expectations within the request. Headers are a way to ensure that the consumer and provider understand one another and are speaking the same language.
