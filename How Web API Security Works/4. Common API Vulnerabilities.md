# Information Disclosure
**Information Disclosure** occurs when an API **shares sensitive data** with **unauthorized or unprivileged users**.
### 🛠️Common Sources of Disclosure
- **API responses** (headers, parameters, verbose errors)
- **Public sources** like:
    - Code repositories
    - Search engine results
    - News/social media
    - Target websites
    - Public API directories

### 🔓Example Vulnerability
```http title="HTTP Request"
GET https://www.sitename.org/wp-json/wp/v2/users
```
May expose user data like:
```json title="HTTP Response"
[{"id":1,"name":"Administrator", "slug":"admin"}]
{"id":2,"name":"Vincent Valentine", "slug":"Vincent"}]
```

These **usernames/slugs** can be used in attacks such as:
- Brute-force
- Credential stuffing
- Password spraying
### ⚠️Verbose Error Messaging
Verbose error messages can unintentionally reveal sensitive internal details like valid usernames, database types, or server versions. These messages help developers debug but also give attackers clues for crafting targeted attacks.
**Example:**
- Error 1: “User ID does not exist” ➝ Invalid username
- Error 2: “Incorrect password” ➝ Valid username, wrong password
### 🔍Other Sensitive Information That Might Be Disclosed
- Software packages and versions
- OS details
- System logs
- Known bugs or stack traces

# Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) is a critical API vulnerability that occurs when **an API fails to properly enforce access control on object-level resources**. This allows an authenticated or unauthenticated user to **access or manipulate another user’s data** by tampering with object identifiers (like user IDs).
### 🎯How BOLA Works
- APIs typically identify resources (users, items, records) via object IDs passed through **parameters**, **URLs**, or **request bodies**.
- If the server **does not verify that the requester is the actual owner of that object**, it might serve or allow changes to someone else’s data.
- Example:
    - Authorized request:

    ``` bash
    GET /api/v3/users?id=5501
```

Returns Cloud Strife’s data.
	  - Unauthorized access attempt:

```bash
GET /api/v3/users?id=5502
```

### 🧪How to Test for BOLA
1. **Identify predictable object IDs** (numeric IDs, usernames, slugs, etc.).
2. **Modify those IDs in requests** to see if access is possible to other users’ resources.
3. Check common URL and parameter structures like:
    - `GET /api/resource/1`
    - `GET /user/account/find?user_id=15`
    - `POST /company/account/Apple/balance`
4. Try tampering with these:
    - `GET /api/resource/3`
    - `GET /user/account/find?user_id=23`
    - `POST /company/account/Google/balance`

If the response returns another user’s data or accepts the request, BOLA exists.

>[!check] Predictable IDs ≠ BOLA by default.
>A system **must fail to validate ownership** for it to be considered vulnerable. BOLA can be **Easy to find** using simple fuzzing and trial-error on predictable IDs. But **hard to detect** if the object IDs are non-sequential or heavily obfuscated (e.g., UUIDs).

# Broken User Authentication 
Broken User Authentication refers to vulnerabilities in the **API’s authentication mechanisms**, allowing unauthorized users to **bypass login, hijack tokens**, or abuse the authentication flow due to weak or misconfigured implementations.
### ⚙️Why It Happens
Authentication **mechanisms are complex** and can fail in multiple ways. APIs are **stateless by design** (especially RESTful APIs), which means:
- No persistent user sessions.
- Clients must prove identity with **each request** using a token or credential.
If any component (e.g. token generation, handling, or registration) is flawed, **attackers can exploit it**.

> [!quote] Bruce Schneier
> “The future of digital systems is complexity, and complexity is the worst enemy of security.

### Common Weak Points
#### 🔑 Token Generation
- Weak entropy/randomness in token creation = **guessable tokens**.
- Attacker could generate or predict valid tokens.
#### 📦 Token Handling
- Poor storage or insecure transmission (e.g., via URLs, in public code).
- **Hard-coded tokens** in front-end JavaScript or GitHub repos.
- Stolen tokens let attackers **assume a valid user’s identity**.
#### 📮 Registration & Reset Flaws
- Password reset mechanisms without rate-limiting:
    - 6-digit code = 1 million possible tries.
    - 4-digit code = 10,000 tries — feasible without protection.
- Unprotected endpoints allowing password reset abuse or brute-force attacks.
#### 👁️ Authentication Bypass Scenarios
- Sensitive resources accessible **without valid authentication**.
- Verbose error messages like:
    - `"Invalid user"` vs `"Wrong password"` → helps attackers verify valid usernames.

### ⚠️Real-World Risks
Exposed API keys (like those in GitHub or public JS):
```json
{
  "client_id": "12345-abcd",
  "client_type": "admin",
  "api_key": "AIzaSyDrbTFCeb5k0yPSfL2heqdF-N19XoLxdw"
}
```
Anyone can impersonate the **admin client**.
- Missing or poor **rate limits** → opens door for brute-force, credential stuffing.
- REST statelessness = **API key = login credentials**. If leaked, **you’re in**.

---
# Excessive Data Exposure
**Excessive Data Exposure** occurs when an API responds with **more data than necessary** to fulfill a request. This often happens when the provider **relies on the client to filter the data**, rather than only sending what’s needed.
### 🔍Example Scenario
A user requests their own account info:
```http 
GET /api/v3/account?name=Cloud+Strife
```
But the API responds with not only the user's info, but also:
```json 
{
	"id": "5501",
	"first_name": "Cloud",
	"last_name": "Strife",
	"privilege": "user",
		"representative":[
			"name": "Don Corneo",
			"id": "2203"
			"email": "dcorn@gmail.com",
			"privilege": "super-admin"
			"admin": true
			"two_factor_auth": false,
}
```

### ⚠️Why It’s Dangerous
- Leaks **sensitive internal data** to unauthorized clients.
- Exposes:
    - **Admin details**
    - **Privilege levels**
    - **Account settings**
- Can **bypass authentication and access controls** just by using the API correctly.
### 🧪How to Detect
- Make simple requests to API endpoints.
- Carefully **inspect all fields in the response**.
- Look for:
    - Hidden internal data
    - Data belonging to **other users**
    - Security configurations (like 2FA status)

---
# Lack of Resources and Rate Limiting
Lack of proper **rate limiting** is a critical API vulnerability that can lead to **Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks and significant **resource or cost misuse**. Rate limiting is essential to control the number of API requests a client can make in a given time, helping protect infrastructure stability and prevent abuse. When an API lacks these controls, an attacker can send a flood of requests to overwhelm the server, causing downtime. Beyond availability, attackers can also **bypass monetization controls**—for example, by exceeding free-tier limits in paid API models like RapidAPI. This can lead to **unexpected scaling costs** or **unauthorized data extraction**.

To test for this issue, an attacker can simply bombard the API with requests and observe if the API responds with rate limiting (typically an HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` response). If not, the API is vulnerable. Even if limits are in place, it’s worth testing how they are enforced and whether they can be bypassed—such as by tweaking parameters, rotating IP addresses, or switching tokens. These kinds of tests help identify weak enforcement mechanisms that allow attackers to circumvent limits and continue making unauthorized or abusive requests.

# Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA)
BFLA occurs when a user from one role (e.g., public, merchant, user) is able to access **functions or actions** intended for another role, especially those with **higher privileges**, like administrators. Unlike BOLA, which is about accessing unauthorized **data**, BFLA is about performing **unauthorized actions**.

### 🧩How BFLA Works
Many APIs define roles (e.g., public user, partner, admin). BFLA happens when APIs fail to enforce **function-level access control**, allowing one role to **invoke functions** meant for another. This can lead to:
- **Privilege escalation** (e.g., a user performing admin tasks)
- **Lateral access** (e.g., a partner using another partner’s features)

### 🧪Real-World Analogy
In a **banking API**,
- **BOLA** lets a user view someone else’s transaction history.
- **BFLA** lets a user **transfer money** or **update other accounts**, even without permission.  
    → BOLA = Access to others' data  
    → BFLA = Performing unauthorized actions

### 📥Endpoint Behavior Example
Privileged actions are often linked to specific **endpoints**:
- Normal user: `GET /user/account/balance`
- Admin: `GET /admin/account/{user}`  
    If access control is broken, a user may access admin routes just by calling them.
Also, vulnerable APIs may allow **unrestricted HTTP methods**. Example:
- `GET` may be allowed for viewing, but if `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` are accepted without proper checks, users might perform unauthorized modifications.

### 🧠What to Look For
- Endpoints with admin-level access (`/admin/`, `/partner/`, etc.)
- Role-sensitive functions like:
    - User creation or deletion
    - Group membership changes
    - Balance transfers, access control changes
- Behavior differences when using different **HTTP verbs**
- Ability to access these functions as a **low-privileged user**

### 🛠️Testing Approach
1. **Explore API documentation** (especially for admin endpoints).
	![[Webex API Documentation.png]] 
2. Use an **unprivileged account** to:
    - Try calling endpoints meant for higher roles.
    - Attempt unauthorized actions (e.g., add users, change group roles).
3. Observe responses:
    - HTTP `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` → access controls are working.
    - HTTP `200 OK` or success responses → **BFLA discovered**.

>[!important] Hint
>If no docs are available, reverse engineer or intercept calls made by higher-privileged users and replicate them.

# Mass Assignment
Mass assignment occurs when an API **blindly accepts extra parameters** in a request and directly maps them to **backend code variables or internal objects**—without validating or filtering which properties should be assignable.

### ⚠️Why It’s Dangerous
If users can modify parameters that were **not meant to be user-controlled**, it can lead to:
- Privilege escalation (e.g., become an admin)
- Altering sensitive fields (e.g., account balance, isVerified, isPremium)
- Unauthorized changes to backend data structures

### 🧪Example Scenario
**Intended request (safe):**
```json 
{
  "User": "scuttleph1sh",
  "Password": "GreatPassword123"
}
```
**Malicious request (mass assignment):**
```json 
{
  "User": "scuttleph1sh",
  "Password": "GreatPassword123",
  "isAdmin": true
}
```

**Vulnerable backend behavior:**
```c++
User newUser = new User(request.body);  // Dangerous: accepts all keys
```
If the app doesn’t **filter or validate** the input keys, it will accept `isAdmin` and assign it—giving unauthorized admin access.

### 🛠️How It Works Internally
- Some frameworks (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Laravel, Express with Mongoose) allow object properties to be assigned in bulk using user input (e.g., `Object.assign(user, req.body)`).
- Without a **whitelist** or **schema validation**, attackers can inject unexpected fields.

### 🔍How to Find Mass Assignment Bugs
#### 🔹Step-by-step:
1. **Study API docs** and identify object-related endpoints (e.g., user creation, update).
2. **Intercept** legitimate API requests using tools like:
    - Burp Suite
    - Postman
    - HTTP Toolkit
3. **Add extra fields** to the request payload—especially:
    - `isAdmin`, `role`, `balance`, `permissions`, `verified`, `email_verified`, etc.
4. **Observe server behavior**:
    - If the extra field gets stored or affects app logic → vulnerability exists.
5. **Fuzz** parameters (automatically inject guesses) to find hidden or undocumented ones.

### 📚Real-World Signs of Mass Assignment
- Creating a user, but being able to assign roles or privileges
- Updating your profile and being able to inject fields like `is_premium`, `plan_type`, etc.
- Discovering undocumented keys in intercepted requests/responses

>[!check] Check 
>🚨 If an API accepts unexpected parameters and stores or executes them, **you may control more than intended**. Always test CRUD endpoints, fuzz JSON payloads, and review backend behaviors for auto-mapped fields.

# Security Misconfigurations
**Security Misconfigurations** include all the mistakes developers could make within the supporting security configurations of an API. Mostly **mistakes in the API's security settings**, which can result in:
- Data exposure
- System compromise
- Full remote code execution (RCE)
- Denial of service (DoS)
They often stem from **default settings, forgotten endpoints, or misused features**.

### ⚠️What Can Go Wrong?
Misconfigurations may include:
- Missing or weak **HTTP security headers**
- **Unpatched** software versions exposed
- Lack of **input sanitization**
- **Verbose error messages**
- Unused or dangerous **HTTP methods** allowed (e.g., PUT, DELETE)
- Missing or broken **TLS encryption**
- **Default accounts or credentials** enabled

### 🧪Examples
#### 🔸 1. 📂Malicious File Upload
- Lack of input sanitization allows file uploads.
- If uploaded files go to public web directories, it can lead to **remote code execution**:
     Uploading `shell.php` → Accessing via URL → Gets a shell
#### 🔸 2. 🧾 Misconfigured Headers
Example:
```http 
X-Powered-By: VulnService 1.11
X-XSS-Protection: 0
X-Response-Time: 566.43
```
- `X-Powered-By`: Leaks tech & version → exploitable if known CVEs exist
- `X-XSS-Protection: 0`: XSS protection is off
- `X-Response-Time`: Can be abused for **resource discovery or timing attacks**
##### 🧠Example Attack
If this request:
```http 
GET /user/account/UserC
X-Response-Time: 510.00 ms
```
Responds significantly slower than:
```http 
GET /user/account/UserA
X-Response-Time: 25.5 ms
```
Then it's likely that **UserC exists**, while A does not.

### 🛡️Missing Transit Encryption
- Not using **TLS/HTTPS** means **sensitive API traffic is sent in plain text**
- Attackers on the same network can use **Wireshark** or MITM proxies to:
    - Intercept data
    - Steal tokens, passwords, or session cookies

### 🔑Default Accounts & Credentials
- If services still use **default usernames/passwords** (e.g., `admin/admin`), attackers can easily log in
- Such accounts may have **privileged access**

### ⚙️Dangerous HTTP Methods
If unnecessary methods like:
- `PUT`
- `DELETE`
- `OPTIONS`
- `TRACE`
...are allowed without proper handling, this can:
- Enable **resource manipulation**
- Expose **debug** or **admin** functions
- Reveal app internals

### 🧰How to Detect Security Misconfigurations
#### ✅ Manual Checks:
- Inspect **response headers**
- Check for **verbose error messages**
- Probe with different HTTP methods
- Check SSL certificate info & encryption strength
- Fuzz file uploads and input parameters
#### 🧪 Automated Tools:
- **Nessus**
- **Qualys**
- **OWASP ZAP**
- **Nikto**
These can scan for:
- Server software versions
- Missing headers
- Cookie flags
- SSL/TLS misconfigs
- Allowed HTTP methods

>[!important] Important
>🧨 Security misconfigurations are the low-hanging fruit of API vulnerabilities. Look for headers, default creds, unnecessary methods, or missing TLS. They're easy to overlook—and even easier to exploit.

# Injection Attacks
Injection flaws exist when a request is passed to the API’s supporting infrastructure and the API provider doesn’t filter the input to remove unwanted characters (a process known as input sanitization). As a result, the infrastructure might treat data from the request as code and run it. Instead of being treated as data, the input is **interpreted as executable code**, leading to potential exploitation.
### ⚠️What Happens Internally?
- API fails to **sanitize/filter** user input.
- Malicious data is sent in the request.
- API passes this to:
    - **SQL database** → SQL Injection
    - **NoSQL database** → NoSQL Injection
    - **System shell** → Command Injection
- Back-end **executes** this data as code.
### 🔎 Signs of Injection Vulnerabilities
- Verbose **error messages** (especially SQL or system errors)
- Unexpected **HTTP response codes**
- Unusual or unstable **API behavior**
### 🧪Example 1: SQL Injection in JSON Body

```http title="HTTP Request"
POST /api/v1/register HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "Fname": "hAPI",
  "Lname": "Hacker",
  "Address": "' OR 1=0--"
}
```
If the backend SQL query uses this value unsafely, it could trigger:
```sql
Error: You have an error in your SQL syntax...
```
✅ **Clue:** Direct error from database confirms SQLi.

### Example 2: System Command Injection via Query Parameter
```http title="HTTP Request"
GET http://10.10.78.181:5000/api/v1/resources/books?show=/etc/passwd
```
If input is passed directly to the system shell or file reader, the response may leak:
```http title="HTTP Response"
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin
man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/usr/sbin/nologin
lp:x:7:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/usr/sbin/nologin
mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/usr/sbin/nologin
news:x:9:9:news:/var/spool/news:/usr/sbin/nologin
```
✅ **Clue:** Getting actual `/etc/passwd` data indicates a command or file inclusion vulnerability.

### 💣Common Injection Types
|Type|Target Backend|Goal|
|---|---|---|
|SQL Injection|SQL Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)|Read/modify data, login bypass|
|NoSQL Injection|MongoDB, CouchDB|Alter queries, bypass auth|
|Command Injection|OS Shell (bash, cmd)|Execute system-level commands|
|LDAP Injection|LDAP Directory Services|Read or alter directory queries|
|XML Injection|XML Parsers|Exploit structure, XXE attacks|
### 🔍How to Detect
1. Inject payloads like:
    - `' OR 1=1--`
    - `; ls -la`
    - `/etc/passwd`
2. Analyze:
    - Response content
    - HTTP status codes
    - Server behavior (crash, delay, leaked info)
### 🛠️Tools to Help
- **Burp Suite**
- **Postman** (manual payload injection)
- **SQLMap** (automated SQLi testing)
- **NoSQLMap**
- **DirBuster / wfuzz** (for fuzzing + traversal)

>[!important] Reminder
>🔓 **Injection flaws** are one of the oldest and most dangerous vulnerabilities. Watch for unsanitized inputs and error messages, and always test parameters carefully. Even small inputs can cause big trouble if not handled correctly.

# Improper Assets Management 
Occurs when organizations **expose outdated, retired, or under-development APIs** to consumers.
These versions:
- May **lack critical security updates**
- Are often **less secure** than production APIs
- Can lead to **further exploitation** if discovered by attackers
### ❗Why It’s Dangerous
Improperly managed assets can be entry points for more severe vulnerabilities like:
- 🔓 **Excessive Data Exposure**
- 🧬 **Information Disclosure**
- 🧪 **Mass Assignment**
- 🕳️ **Injection Attacks**
- 🚫 **Improper Rate Limiting**
### 🔍 How to Identify It
#### ✅ API Version Clues:
- Older versions like `/v1/`, `/v2/`, etc.
- Deprecated but still accessible paths.
```bash
/api/v1/admin
/api/v1/user/settings
```
#### ✅ Development Stage Clues:
- Alpha/beta/dev/test paths:
```bash
/alpha/
/beta/
/uat/
/demo/
/staging/
```
#### ✅ Documentation & Changelogs:
- Outdated docs may point to old/retired endpoints still online
- Changelogs might hint at:
    - Fixed vulnerabilities in old versions
    - Reasons for endpoint replacement
#### ✅ Real-World Trick:
If current doc shows:
```bash
https://api.example.com/v3/users
```
But older docs mention:
```bash
https://api.example.com/v1/users
```
Test the old one — it might still be online and exploitable.

### 🧪Discovery Methods
|Technique|Description|
|---|---|
|🔍 Version Fuzzing|Try `/v0/` to `/v10/` to find active old versions|
|📚 Doc Review|Look for outdated links or endpoint references|
|🧾 Changelog Scan|Identify deprecated features that are still active|
|🧠 Pattern Guessing|Recognize naming conventions in API paths|
|🧨 Brute Forcing|Automate path guessing (e.g., `/test/`, `/dev/`)|
### 🛠️Tools to Help
- **Burp Suite** (Repeater & Intruder)
- **ffuf** or **dirsearch** (for fuzzing paths)
- **Postman** (manual exploration)
- **GitHub** (look for stale docs or commit history)
- **Wayback Machine** (find old API versions once publicly documented)

>[!success] ⚠️Retired and dev APIs are a goldmine for attackers.
>If endpoints like `/beta/`, `/v1/`, or `/demo/` are still active, treat them as **potential backdoors** to production systems.  
Always test deprecated versions, and don’t trust just the latest documentation.

# Business Logic Vulnerabilities/Flaws 
**Business Logic Vulnerabilities** are **flaws in an application's intended behavior** that attackers can exploit to achieve malicious goals.  
They arise not from programming mistakes, but from **faulty assumptions** made by developers or API providers about how users will behave.

### 🧨 Key Characteristics
- Exploits **expected functionality** in **unexpected ways**
- Often results from **overtrusting the API consumer**
- Hard to detect using **automated scanners**
- Requires a deep understanding of the **application’s behavior and business model**
### 🚨Real-World Examples
#### 🧬 1. Improper File Validation
> API allows uploads of encoded files, assuming consumers won't abuse this.  
> ✅ Attacker uploads a malicious file encoded in base64 → decoded and executed by server.
#### 🧬 2. Experian API Leak (2021)
> A partner embedded API credit checks in their app.  
> ❌ Anyone could intercept and use it to get credit info — no extra validation on Experian’s end.
#### 🧬 3. Bypassing MFA via Parameter Tampering
```HTTP
POST /api/v1/login
UserId=hapihacker&password=arealpassword!&MFA=false
```
Changing `MFA=true` to `false` might bypass MFA if backend logic fails to enforce it properly.

### ⚠️Why It Happens
- Developers **assume trust**:
    - “Only admins will do X.”
    - “Users won’t tamper with requests.”
    - “This feature is meant only for Y.”
- API providers fail to **enforce behavior** with **technical controls**
- **Stolen credentials** (API keys/tokens) are misused by attackers disguised as trusted users

>[!danger] Red Flags in documentation
>When you see lines like:
> - “Only use X for Y”
> - “This endpoint is not for direct use”
> - “Only admins should call this” 
>These **suggest trust-based logic**, which you should challenge in your tests.
### 🔧 Discovery Techniques
|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|🔄 Modify parameters|Change values (e.g., `MFA=true` → `false`, `role=user` → `role=admin`)|
|📜 Analyze docs|Find mentions of "should not", "do not", "only used for"|
|🔍 Monitor trust flaws|Look for overly trusted third-party integrations|
|🧪 Replay & tamper|Use **Burp Suite**, **Postman**, or **Fiddler** to alter requests|
|🧠 Think adversarially|Understand business flow, then break assumptions|-
