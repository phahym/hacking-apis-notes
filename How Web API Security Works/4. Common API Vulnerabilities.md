# Information Disclosure
**Information Disclosure** occurs when an API **shares sensitive data** with **unauthorized or unprivileged users**.
### 🛠️Common Sources of Disclosure
- **API responses** (headers, parameters, verbose errors)
- **Public sources** like:
    - Code repositories
    - Search engine results
    - News/social media
    - Target websites
    - Public API directories

### 🔓Example Vulnerability
```http title="HTTP Request"
GET https://www.sitename.org/wp-json/wp/v2/users
```
May expose user data like:
```json title="HTTP Response"
[{"id":1,"name":"Administrator", "slug":"admin"}]
{"id":2,"name":"Vincent Valentine", "slug":"Vincent"}]
```

These **usernames/slugs** can be used in attacks such as:
- Brute-force
- Credential stuffing
- Password spraying
### ⚠️Verbose Error Messaging
Verbose error messages can unintentionally reveal sensitive internal details like valid usernames, database types, or server versions. These messages help developers debug but also give attackers clues for crafting targeted attacks.
**Example:**
- Error 1: “User ID does not exist” ➝ Invalid username
- Error 2: “Incorrect password” ➝ Valid username, wrong password
### 🔍Other Sensitive Information That Might Be Disclosed
- Software packages and versions
- OS details
- System logs
- Known bugs or stack traces

>[!danger] Exploit 
>This information can aid attackers in finding vulnerabilities or planning further exploitation.

# Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) is a critical API vulnerability that occurs when **an API fails to properly enforce access control on object-level resources**. This allows an authenticated or unauthenticated user to **access or manipulate another user’s data** by tampering with object identifiers (like user IDs).
### 🎯How BOLA Works
- APIs typically identify resources (users, items, records) via object IDs passed through **parameters**, **URLs**, or **request bodies**.
- If the server **does not verify that the requester is the actual owner of that object**, it might serve or allow changes to someone else’s data.
- Example:
    - Authorized request:
    ``` bash
    GET /api/v3/users?id=5501
```
Returns Cloud Strife’s data.
	  - Unauthorized access attempt:
```bash
GET /api/v3/users?id=5502
```

### 🧪How to Test for BOLA
1. **Identify predictable object IDs** (numeric IDs, usernames, slugs, etc.).
2. **Modify those IDs in requests** to see if access is possible to other users’ resources.
3. Check common URL and parameter structures like:
    - `GET /api/resource/1`
    - `GET /user/account/find?user_id=15`
    - `POST /company/account/Apple/balance`
4. Try tampering with these:
    - `GET /api/resource/3`
    - `GET /user/account/find?user_id=23`
    - `POST /company/account/Google/balance`

If the response returns another user’s data or accepts the request, BOLA exists.

>[!check] Predictable IDs ≠ BOLA by default.
>A system **must fail to validate ownership** for it to be considered vulnerable. BOLA can be **Easy to find** using simple fuzzing and trial-error on predictable IDs. But **hard to detect** if the object IDs are non-sequential or heavily obfuscated (e.g., UUIDs).
