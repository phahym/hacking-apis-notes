It provide frameworks to design APIs, create consistent documentation, and ensure developers and users have clear expectations of API functionality. Without specifications, APIs lack consistency, making it difficult for consumers to interact with various APIs seamlessly. Specifications are like standard **electric sockets** – they allow developers to interact with different APIs using a common format.

>[!info] Standard specification
>OpenAPI Specification 3.0 (OAS), previously known as Swagger, is one of the leading specifications for RESTful APIs.
>
>The RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is another way to consistently generate API documentation. RAML is an open specification that works exclusively with YAML for document formatting. Similar to OAS, RAML was designed to document, design, build, and test REST APIs.

## API Data Interchange Formats
APIs use several formats to facilitate the exchange of data. Additionally, specifications use these formats to document APIs. Some APIs, like SOAP, require a specific format, whereas others allow the client to specify the format to use in the request and response body.
### JSON
**JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)** is both human-readable and easily parsable by applications. JSON represents objects as key/value pairs separated by commas, within a pair of curly brackets, as follows:

```json title="JSON"
{
"firstName": "James",
"lastName": "Lovell",
"tripsToTheMoon": 2,
"isAstronaut": true,
"walkedOnMoon": false,
"comment" : "This is a comment",
"spacecrafts": ["Gemini 7", "Gemini 12", "Apollo 8", "Apollo 13"],
"book": [
{
"title": "Lost Moon",
"genre": "Non-fiction"
}
]
}
```

>[!important] Comment Problem 
>JSON does not allow inline comments, so any sort of comment-like communications must take place as a key/value pair like "comment" : "This is a comment".

---
### XML
**Extensible Markup Language (XML)** is characterized by the descriptive tags it uses to wrap data. Although REST APIs can use XML, it is most commonly associated with SOAP APIs. `SOAP APIs can only use XML as the data interchange.`

```xml title="XML structure"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> 1

## API Authentication
API authentication is a way to verify user identity (**Authentication**) and determine allowed access (**Authorization**). Consumers must send identifying information with each request, which the provider verifies before granting or denying access.
##### Authentication Explained
- **Authentication:** Proving and verifying a user’s identity.
		- Commonly done using **credentials** (e.g., username/email & password).
		- Server compares provided credentials against stored credentials.
		- If valid, a **user session** is created, and a **cookie** is issued to the client.

>[!important] API Authentication (REST & GraphQL)
>Unlike traditional web applications, **REST and GraphQL APIs are stateless**. No persistent user sessions; the client must **authenticate with each request**. Typically achieved through methods like **API keys, tokens, or other credentials** passed with each request.

### Basic Authentication
The simplest form of API authentication is HTTP basic authentication, in which the consumer includes their username and password in a header or the body of a request. The API could either pass the username and password to the provider in plain text, like username:password, or it could encode the credentials using something like base64 to save space (for example, `asdXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQK`)

>[!danger] Attention
>Encoding is not encryption. If base64-encoded data is captured, it can easily be decoded

### API Keys
API keys are unique strings that API providers generate and grant to authorize access for approved consumers. Once an API consumer has a key, they can include it in requests whenever specified by the provider. The provider will typically require that the consumer pass the key in query `string parameters, request headers, body data, or as a cookie when they make a request.` Examples:

- API key included in the query string of the URL:
	- `/api/v1/users?apikey=ju574n3x4mpl34p1k3y`
- The following is an API key included as a header:
	- `"API-Secret": "17813fg8-46a7-5006-e235-45be7e9f2345"`
- Finally, here is an API key passed in as a cookie:
	- `Cookie: API-Key= 4n07h3r4p1k3y`

>[!attention] Security Talk
>API keys can be more secure than basic authentication for several reasons. When keys are sufficiently long, complex, and randomly generated, they can be exceedingly difficult for an attacker to guess or brute-force. Additionally, providers can set expiration dates to limit the length of time for which the keys are valid.

### JSON Web Token (JWT)
JWT consist of three parts, all of which are base64-encoded and separated by periods: the header, the payload, and the signature. The header includes information about the algorithm used to sign the payload. The payload is the data included within the token, such as a username, time stamp, and issuer. The signature is the encoded and encrypted message used to validate the token. 
The table below shows  an example of these parts, unencoded for readability, as well as the final token.

### HMAC
**HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code)** A primary API authentication method used by **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. It ensures **message integrity and authenticity** by verifying that the message was not tampered with and originated from a legitimate source.
#### How HMAC Works
1. **Shared Secret Key:** Provider creates a secret key and shares it with the consumer.
2. **Message Digest Creation:**
    - When the consumer sends an API request, an **HMAC hash function** is applied to:
        - The **request data**.
        - The **secret key**.
    - The resulting hash (known as a **message digest**) is sent with the request.
3. **Verification by Provider:**
    - The provider **recalculates the HMAC** using the same key and request data.
    - Compares the provider’s hash value with the consumer’s hash value.
    - If the hashes match, the request is **authorized**. If not, the request is rejected due to:
        - Incorrect secret key.
        - Tampered message.

Common HMAC Algorithms:

| Algorithm   | Hash Output                                                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HMAC-MD5    | f37438341e3d22aa11b4b2e838120dcf                                                                                                         |
| HMAC-SHA1   | 4c2de361ba8958558de3d049ed1fb5c115656e65                                                                                                 |
| HMAC-SHA256 | 8e8e73ffbd9a953f2ec892f06f9a5e91e6551023d1942ec7994fa1a78a5aeb6c                                                                         |
| HMAC-SHA512 | 6434a354a730f888865bc5755d9f498126d8f67d73f<br>32ccd2b775c47c91ce26b66dfa59c25aed7f4a6bcb<br>4786d3a3c6130f63ae08367822af3f967d3a7469e1b |
>[!note] Information
>There are currently no known vulnerabilities affecting HMAC-SHA1 and HMAC-MD5, but these functions are cryptographically weaker than SHA-256 and SHA-512. However, the more secure functions are also slower

### OAuth 2.0
**OAuth 2.0** is an **authorization standard** enabling different services to access each other’s data via **APIs**. It facilitates **service-to-service communication** without requiring users to share their credentials.
#### How OAuth 2.0 Works (Example: Twitter & LinkedIn)
- **Service Provider:** Twitter (the API providing access to data).
- **Client/Application:** LinkedIn (the application requesting access).
- **Resource Owner:** The user authorizing access (you).
![[OAuth.png]]
- **Authorization Request:**
    - LinkedIn requests access to your Twitter account to share tweets.
- **User Authorization:**
    - You approve this request via `api.twitter.com`.
- **Token Generation:**
    - Twitter generates a **limited, time-based access token** for LinkedIn.
- **Token Usage:**
    - LinkedIn uses the token to post tweets on your behalf without storing your Twitter credentials.

#### OAuth Components
1. **Resource Owner:** The user granting permission (e.g., you).
2. **Client:** The application requesting access (e.g., LinkedIn).
3. **Authorization Server:** Generates tokens (e.g., Twitter’s API server).
4. **Resource Server:** Provides access to protected resources (e.g., Twitter’s backend).
![[OAuth Model.png]]

>[!success] Benefits
>Increased security by **avoiding credential sharing**. Tokens are **time-based and limited in scope**, enhancing security.

>[!danger] Potential Security Flaws
>OAuth can expose themselves to a variety of attacks such as token injection, authorization code reuse, cross-site request forgery, invalid redirection, and phishing.
