Web APIs facilitate a **client/server relationship** between the API provider (host) and the API consumer (user/system). Communication occurs via **HTTP requests**.
### Resources
- Data requested by the API consumer.
- **Singleton Resource:** A unique object, e.g., `/api/user/{user_id}`.
- **Collection:** A group of resources, e.g., `/api/profiles/users`.
- **Sub-collection:** A collection within a specific resource, e.g., `/api/user/{user_id}/settings`.
### API Gateway
Acts as an **entry point to a web application**. Filters bad requests, monitors traffic, and routes requests to proper services. Handles security controls:
1. Authentication
2. Authorization
3. SSL Encryption (Encryption to transit)
4. Rate Limiting
5. Load Balancing
### API Endpoint
API endpoints are **URLs for interacting with parts of the API**. Examples:
```Endpoint
https://example.com/api/v3/users/
https://example.com/api/v3/customers/
https://example.com/api/updated_on/
https://example.com/api/state/1/
```
### Micro-services
**Modular pieces** of a web application handling specific functions. Uses APIs to **transfer data and trigger actions**. Example: Payment gateway handling billing, logging, and emailing separately.

### `CRUD` Operations
> Stands for **Create, Read, Update, Delete** - fundamental actions for interacting with APIs. CRUD is a convention, but APIs may support other operations.
- **Create:** Adding new records (**POST requests**).
- **Read:** Retrieving data (**GET requests**).
- **Update:** Modifying existing records (**POST or PUT requests**).
- **Delete:** Removing records (**POST or DELETE requests**).
### Path Parameters
**Path parameters** are variables used within URLs. Example: `{client_id}` or `{access_token}` in endpoints. Often denoted by curly brackets `{}` but may also use colons `:` or square brackets `[]`

>[!TOKEN]
>**Tokens:** Used by API providers to **identify and authorize requests**.
