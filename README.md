As a passionate learner and ethical hacker, I’m currently reading _Hacking APIs_ and documenting every key idea, technique, and takeaway in a structured, readable format.

This repository serves as:  
- 🧠 A **study companion** for myself  
- 🔍 A **reference guide** for others exploring API security  
- 💬 A way to share, revise, and grow this knowledge over time
