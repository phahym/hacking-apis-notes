# Analyzing Web Apps with DevTools
**Chrome DevTools** is a suite of tools built into Google Chrome that allows developers and hackers to analyze web applications, identify how they interact with APIs, and find security insights.
## üß∞ Installing Google Chrome on Kali
```bash
sudo wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
```
**To launch Chrome from the terminal:**
```bash
google-chrome
```

## üñ•Ô∏èLaunching DevTools
- Keyboard Shortcuts: `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `F12`
- Menu: Settings ‚Üí More Tools ‚Üí Developer Tools
- Refresh Page: `Ctrl+R` (to reload and capture requests)
## üîéDevTools Panels Overview
| Panel           | Purpose                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Elements**    | Allows you to view the current page‚Äôs CSS and Document Object Model (DOM), which enables you to inspect the HTML that constructs the web page. |
| **Console**     | Provides you with alerts and lets you interact with the JavaScript debugger to alter the current web page.                                     |
| **Sources**     | Contains the directories that make up the web application and the content of the source files.                                                 |
| **Network**     | Lists all the source file requests that make up the client‚Äôs perspectiveof the web application.                                                |
| **Performance** | Provides a way to record and analyze all the events that take place when loading a web page.                                                   |
| **Memory**      | Lets you record and analyze how the browser is interacting with your system‚Äôs memory.                                                          |
| **Application** | Provides you with the application manifest, storage items (like cookies and session information), cache, and background services.              |
| **Security**    | Provides insight regarding the transit encryption, source content origins, and certificate details.                                            |
## üß™Use Cases
- Discover APIs behind the web app
- Examine request/response flow (especially JSON)
- Analyze headers (e.g. auth tokens, cookies, content-types)
- Detect sensitive data (via `Sources`)
- Bypass logic by altering JavaScript behavior in `Console`
- Watch user actions trigger API calls using `Performance`
## üîóResources

>[!tip] üîêTip:
>Before launching any attack, **observe how the application behaves**‚Äîthe deeper you understand its behavior, the better chance you have at finding vulnerabilities.

>[!example] Performance Tab
>Performance panel is mainly used to improve a website‚Äôs speed, but we could also use it to observe at what point a web application interacts with an API. In the picture below, we see that, 1,700 milliseconds in, a client event triggered the Twitter application to interact with the API. As the client, we would then be able to correlate that event to an action we took on the page, such as authenticating to the web app, to know what the web application is using the API for. The more information we can gather before attacking an API, the better our odds will be at finding and exploiting vulnerabilities.

# Capturing and Modifying Requests with Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a powerful toolkit by PortSwigger used for web app and API testing. It supports intercepting HTTP requests, fuzzing, brute-forcing, spidering, and more.
## üß∞Key Features of Burp Suite
- **Intercept Requests**: Capture and view HTTP requests/responses.
- **Spidering**: Auto-discover URL paths via HTML links.
- **Fuzzing**: Send varied input to find unexpected behavior.
- **Modular Tools**: Includes Proxy, Intruder, Repeater, Decoder, Comparer, Sequencer, etc.
## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Burp Suite Community Edition (CE) is included in Kali by default. If not:
```bash
sudo apt-get install burpsuite
```
## üåê Setting Up FoxyProxy
To simplify proxy config in browsers:
1. Install **FoxyProxy Standard** from your browser's add-on store.
2. Set proxy:
    - Host: `127.0.0.1`
    - Port: `8080`
    - Name it: `Hackz`
3. Toggle proxy on/off with one click.
## üîêAdd Burp CA Certificate
To bypass HTTPS protection (HSTS):
1. Start Burp Suite.
2. Open browser, enable FoxyProxy, and visit: `http://burpsuite`
3. Download the CA certificate.
4. Import it:
    - In Firefox: `Preferences > Certificates`
    - In Chrome: `Settings > Manage Certificates > Authorities`

## üö¶Intercepting Requests
1. Turn **Intercept On** in Burp Proxy.
2. Enable FoxyProxy in your browser and navigate to a site.
3. Request gets held in Burp.
4. Right-click the request to forward it to tools like **Repeater**.
## üîÅUsing Repeater
- Allows modifying and resending requests.
- Observe API behavior in a clean, controlled way.
## üöÄUsing Intruder
- Allows automated request generation with variables (`¬ßpayload¬ß`).
- Select parts of request to fuzz.
### üéØAttack Types
- **Sniper**: One payload, one position at a time.
- **Battering Ram**: Same payload to all positions.
- **Pitchfork**: Multiple payload sets, one-to-one mapping.
- **Cluster Bomb**: All combinations of multiple payload sets.
> Example: Replace a password field with a list of strings to brute-force login.
### üîçTargets for Intruder
- BOLA
- Broken Auth
- Mass Assignment
- Injection
- Improper Asset Management
## Extending the Power of Burp Suite
One of the biggest advantages of using Burp Suite is the ability to install custom extensions, which enhance its API hacking capabilities. These extensions are available in the BApp Store and can be installed directly from the Extender tab. Some may have additional installation requirements, so it‚Äôs important to follow the instructions provided for each one.

| **Extension Name**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Autorize**        | Automates authorization testing, especially for BOLA vulnerabilities. It compares access between two users (e.g., UserA and UserB) to detect unauthorized access. |
| **JSON Web Tokens** | Helps analyze, modify, and attack JWTs (JSON Web Tokens). Useful for authorization-related testing.                                                               |
| **InQL Scanner**    | A tool for attacking GraphQL APIs. It can map out GraphQL schemas and help identify vulnerable queries and fields.                                                |
| **IP Rotate**       | Rotates your IP address to simulate requests from different regions or cloud hosts. Useful for bypassing IP-based rate limits or bans.                            |
| **Bypass WAF**      | Adds spoofed headers like `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Originating-IP` to bypass certain Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). Saves time from adding them manually.      |
